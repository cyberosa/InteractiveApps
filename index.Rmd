### 28 October 2017
Try to find the capital by clicking in the suggested cities... Good luck!


```{r load the library, echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```


```{r create the map, echo=FALSE}
lat <-c(-33.865143,-16.925491,-31.953512,-34.206841,-35.28204)
lng <-c(151.209900,145.754120,115.857048,142.136490,149.12858)
game <- c("No, but you are close","Cairns is not the capital","You are too far","Mildura is not the capital","Canberra, yes! You find it!")    
df <- data.frame(lat,lng)
```
```{r play}
df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(popup = game)
```
